# Car_Classification_Python_2022

# Introduction :
This article discusses the classification of automobiles based on vehicle laws or market segments. See Car body style for information on different body styles (such as sedan, coupe, and hatchback).
Car classification schemes have been devised by governments and commercial organizations for a variety of goals, including regulation, description, and categorization of automobiles.


ISO 3833-1977 is an international standard. Road vehicles – Types – Words and Definitions also defines terms used to categorize automobiles.

# Working of Claasification :
Automobile classification It assesses the car's horsepower and seat to determine what type of vehicle it is and which group it belongs to, such as motorcycles, vans, and supercars etc.

# Types of Car Classification :
Car classify is the name of our project, and it is the process of classifying autos. By employing cameras to identify horsepower and seats of each automobile that passes through, it can be determined what type of vehicle it is. A clearing image, for example, is a camera's breakdown of each car to determine horsepower, seats, and other characteristics.

# Problem Statement :
For some cars, such as current electric vehicles, we may not have enough data to detect horsepower and seats. and a foreign-made automobile As a result, we must bring this information to be studied further.

# Requirements :
  Jupyter Notebook
  
# Importing the Libraries :
  Tree

# Conclusion :
as a result of developments in image processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other related technologies There will be millions of robots on the planet in a few decades. it will alter our way of existence Voice instructions are a part of these improvements. Prepare for government data requests, translate languages, and identify and track people and things. Medical diagnostics, surgery, human DNA flaw programming, and self-driving cars are all possibilities. and a variety of different applications, including real-life counting The possibilities are infinite. and in the future, whether on the road, at a tourist attraction, or in retail stores To pass through that path, it must have an automobile detector.
