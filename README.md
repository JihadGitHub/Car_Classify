# Introduction
This article is about the categorisation of cars according to vehicle regulations or market segments. For types of body styles (e.g. sedan, coupe, hatchback), see Car body style.
Governments and private organizations have developed car classification schemes that are used for various purposes including regulation, description, and categorization of cars.
